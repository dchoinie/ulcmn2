          University Lutheran Chapel seeks to provide a safe and secure
          environment for the children who participate in our programs and
          activities. By implementing the below practices, our goal is to
          protect the children so involved from incidents of misconduct or
          inappropriate behavior while also protecting our staff and volunteers
          from false accusations.

        <p className="text-xl has-text-info my-2">General Rule</p>
        <p>Violations of the 6th commandment are prohibited.</p>
        <p className="text-xl has-text-info my-2">Definitions</p>
        <p>
          For purposes of this policy:
          <ul className="unordered-dots">
            <li>
              the terms “child” or “children” include all persons under the age
              of eighteen
            </li>
            <li>
              the term “child abuse” refers to any action (or lack of action)
              that endangers or harms a child’s physical, psychological, or
              emotional health and development
            </li>
            <li>
              where an individual desiring to work with children is him/herself
              a child as defined above, that individual must be at least
              fourteen years old or confirmed, whichever comes first, and that
              individual will be subject to all policies contained herein as
              regards their position working with children
            </li>
            <li>
              it is assumed and understood that parent-to-child interaction on
              the premises is the sole responsibility of the parent and does not
              fall under this policy

        </p>
        <p className="text-xl has-text-info my-2">Selection Of Workers</p>
        <p>
          All persons who desire to work with the children participating in our
          programs and activities will be screened. This screening includes the
          following:
          <ul className="unordered-dots">
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Six month rule:</span>
              <p>
                No applicant will be considered for any position involving
                contact with minors until s/he has been involved with University
                Lutheran Chapel for a minimum of six months. This time of
                interaction between our leadership and the applicant allows for
                better evaluation and suitability of the applicant for working
                with children.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Written application:</span>
              <p>
                All persons seeking to work with children must complete and sign
                a written application in a form to be supplied by us. The
                application will request basic information from the applicant
                and will inquire into previous experience with children,
                previous church affiliations, reference and employment
                information, as well as disclosure of any previous criminal
                convictions or participation in sexual misconduct. The
                application form will be maintained in confidence on file at
                University Lutheran Chapel.
              </p>

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Personal interview:</span>
              <p>
                Upon completion of the application, a face-to-face interview may
                be scheduled with the applicant to discuss his/her suitability
                for the position.

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Reference checks:</span>
              <p>
                Before any applicant is permitted to work with children,
                University Lutheran Chapel may elect to perform reference
                checks. These references should be of an institutional nature as
                opposed to personal or family references, preferably from
                organizations where the applicant has worked with children in
                the past, e.g. past churches. Documentation of the reference
                checks will be maintained in confidence on file at University
                Lutheran Chapel.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold">Criminal background check:</span>
              <p>
                A national criminal background check is required for all
                employees. University Lutheran Chapel reserves the right to
                conduct a criminal background check on all volunteers, including
                those working with children. An authorization to perform a
                background check will be included as part of the written
                application referenced above. If an individual declines to sign
                this authorization, s/he will be unable to work with children.
                The background check authorization form and results will be
                maintained in confidence on file at University Lutheran Chapel.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          The Pastor, in consultation with the Board of Elders if necessary,
          will determine whether an applicant or volunteer has committed an
          offense that would disqualify the individual from working with
          children on a case-by-case basis in light of all the surrounding
          circumstances. Generally, convictions for an offense involving
          children and/or for offenses involving violence, dishonesty, illegal
          substances, indecency, and any conduct contrary to our mission will
          preclude someone from being permitted to work with children. Failure
          to disclose a criminal conviction on the application form will be a
          disqualifying event.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl has-text-info my-2">Two Adult Policy</p>
        <p>
          It is our goal that a minimum of two unrelated adult workers will be
          in attendance at all times when children are being supervised during
          our programs and activities. Youth classes may have only one adult
          teacher in attendance during class sessions; in these instances, doors
          to the classroom should remain open and there should be no fewer than
          three students with the adult teacher. We do not allow minors to be
          alone with one adult on our premises or in any sponsored activity
          unless in a counseling or pastoral care situation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl has-text-info my-2">Open Door Policy</p>
        <p>
          Classroom doors should remain open unless there is a window in the
          door or a side window beside it. Doors should never be locked while
          persons are inside the room except in an extreme case of emergency.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl has-text-info my-2">Discipline Policy</p>
        <p>
          Corporal punishment will not be administered, even if parents have
          suggested or given permission for it. There should be no spanking,
          grabbing, hitting, or other physical discipline of children. Workers
          should consult with parents and/or the Pastor if assistance is needed
          with disciplinary issues.

          Responding to Allegations of Child Abuse
        </p>
        <p>
          Child abuse occurs in different ways and includes the following:
          <ul className="unordered-dots">
            <li>
              Physical abuse: any physical injury to a child that is not
              accidental, such as beating, shaking, burns, and biting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Emotional abuse: emotional injury when the child is not nurtured
              or provided with love and security, such as an environment of
              constant unwarranted criticism, belittling, and persistent or
              malicious teasing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sexual abuse: any sexual activity between a child and an adult or
              between a child and another child, including activities such as
              fondling, exhibitionism, intercourse, incest, and pornography.
            </li>
            <li>
              Neglect: depriving a child of his/her essential needs, such as
              adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          Childcare workers may have the opportunity to become aware of abuse or
          neglect of the children under our care. In the event that an
          individual involved in the care of children at University Lutheran
          Chapel becomes aware of suspected abuse or neglect of a child under
          his/her care, this should be reported immediately to the Pastor for
          further action including reporting to authorities as may be mandated
          by law.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          In the event that an incident of abuse or neglect is alleged to have
          occurred at University Lutheran Chapel or during our sponsored
          programs or activities, the following procedure shall be followed:
          <ol className="ordered-list">
            <li>The parent of guardian of the child will be notified.</li>
            <li>
              The worker alleged to be the perpetrator of the abuse or
              misconduct will immediately be suspended from working with
              children pending an investigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Civil authorities will be notified and University Lutheran Chapel
              will comply with applicable laws regarding mandatory reporting of
              abuse as the law then exists. University Lutheran Chapel will
              fully cooperate with the investigation of the incident by the
              civil authorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our insurance company will be notified, and we will complete an
              incident report. Any documents received relating to the incident
              and/or allegations will immediately be forwarded to the insurance
              company.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any representations made to the media will only occur after
              approval by the Board of Elders and legal counsel. All other
              representatives of the congregation should refrain from speaking
              to the media.
            </li>
            <li>Pastoral care will be arranged for any who desire it.</li>
            <li>
              Any person who is not found innocent of the alleged abuse or
              misconduct will be removed from their position working with
              children.
