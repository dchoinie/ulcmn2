          The pastor&#40;s&#41; of University Lutheran Chapel will not under any
          circumstances conduct marriages that are not in accord with the
          teachings of the Holy Scriptures of the Christian Faith, in particu-
          lar, unions, whether sanctioned by the state or not, consisting of
          anything other than one man and one woman. The facilities of
          University Lutheran Chapel will not be used for marriages other than

          Regarding Gender and Marriage
        </p>
        <p>
          In the beginning God created humans as either male or female. He did
          not create them without a gender nor did he create anyone with
          multiple genders. &#40;Gen 1:27 & 2:22&#41; Those who present
          themselves differently than the gender God gave them when they were
          procreated reject God’s design for them. o In the beginning God
          defined marriage as the union of one man and one woman. &#40;Gen
          2:24&#41; Our Lord Jesus Christ cited Gen 2:24 in reiterating the
          definition of marriage. &#40;Mk 10:7-8a&#41; &#40;Adopted November 13,

        <p className="font-bold underline my-2">Regarding Life Issues</p>
        <p>
          We believe that all human life is sacred and created by God in His
          image. Human life is of inestimable worth in all its dimensions,
          including pre-born babies, the aged, the physically or mentally
          challenged, and every other stage or condition from conception through
          natural death. We are therefore called to defend, protect, and value
          all human life. &#40;Adopted November 13, 2017&#41;

        <p className="font-bold underline my-2">Regarding Excommunication</p>
        <p>
          When an issue of excommunication arises, the pastor shall make the
          determination regarding excommunication after consultation with the
          elders. When a member is excommunicated the action will be announced
          to the congregation. The pastor shall also make the determination,
          after consultation with the elders, whether to reveal to the
          congregation and to what extent, if any, the reason&#40;s&#41; for the
          excommunication. &#40;Adopted November 13, 2017&#41;

          Regarding Paid Church Workers
        </p>
        <p>
          All paid church workers of ULC shall sign a copy of the following
          statement at the time of accepting a call or of being hired:
          <br />
          <em>
            I understand that I am to conduct my life, both at work and away
            from work, in a Christian manner as taught in the Bible and the
            Lutheran Confessions and as understood by ULC and that failure to do
            so is grounds for excommunication and/or release of call or
            dismissal from employment.

          Regarding Use of ULC Facilities
        </p>
        <p>
          Use of the facilities owned by ULC is limited to the members of ULC
          and their guests. ULC sponsored events take priority over all other
          events. ULC’s chapel council must approve by adopted resolution the
          use of ULC facilities by any entity other than a member of ULC. Such
          use shall only be allowed to extend to those who are in fellowship
          with ULC. &#40;Adopted November 19, 2017&#41;

        <p className="font-bold underline my-2">Regarding Closed Communion</p>
        <p>
          In accordance with the apostolic command and in unity with the
          unbroken practice of the Church, University Lutheran Chapel practices
          Closed Communion. If you are not a member of a congregation in
          fellowship with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod we kindly ask you
          to re- frain from communing. We do so not to offend you, but because
          the Scriptures clearly teach that those communing together be unified
          in their confession of the Faith. In this Sacrament we are not only
          joined to Christ our Head who is present in His body and blood, but
          are also knit together with one another as His Body, in which there
          should be no division of belief. Should you have questions or concerns
          about this Biblical and historic doctrine, please speak with our
          pastor.
